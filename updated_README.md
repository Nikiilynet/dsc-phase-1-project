# Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

We have decided to proceed with the following datasets
* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross


### Business understanding

*Microsoft are trying to create a new movie studio as they want to get into the industry, but they don’t understand anything about creating movies.

How do we assist them to explore what types of films are currently doing the best in the box office?

The datasets will help us to answer the following questions?
What type of data does this datasets have?
Does the dataset have missing values that are necessary or unnecessary
How can we analyse this data to understand which is the top genres in the movie industry?
Which is the top genre in most of the years?
What is the total domestic gross used in the movie industry?
The average rating of each top genre?
The Frequency of the domestic gross for the top 10 studios
And the distribution of runtime in minutes

## Summary
The jupyter notebook showcases all the analysis from the 3 datasets and more explanatation of the movie data visualisations
From this findings the microsoft team can be able to have a way forward on which genre and how long the movie should take and also the amount of money they can make from the movie so as to plan on a budget.
